# KR210 Robotic arm - Pick & Place project
This project is adopted from Udacity - Robotics NanoDegree Program. Modified and Implemented the Pick and Place Functionality with new approaches.

This documentation demonstrates my perception and the steps involved in completing this project. 

Initial setup of ROS+Gazebo with VMware Fusion can be found in the Installation_instr.md file in this repo.

## Problem Statement:
Identify target object on the shelf, plan and perform a clean movement towards the object to grasp the object and place the in in the bin.

### Tools used:
RVIZ:

Gazebo:

MoveIT! is the software for building mobile manipulation applications.It integrates perception, kinematics, motion planning, trajectory processing and execution.

If any of these items are missing, report as an issue.

Once all these items are confirmed, open rviz window, hit Next button.

To view the complete demo keep hitting Next after previous action is completed successfully. 

Since debugging is enabled, you should be able to see diagnostic output on various terminals that have popped up.

The demo ends when the robot arm reaches at the top of the drop location. 

There is no loopback implemented yet, so you need to close all the terminal windows in order to restart.

In case the demo fails, close all three terminal windows and rerun the script.
